"schoolLifeDescription": "JIS runs a house system across grade levels with inter-house competitions in sports, arts, and community service. 'JIS Week' in February is the main cultural event, featuring performances, food fairs, and cultural presentations reflecting the school's international mix. The school competes in IASAS (Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asian Schools) against six other leading international schools across the region, and sport is a significant part of secondary school life. The arts programme produces large-scale musicals annually and there are dedicated music, drama, and visual arts spaces. Service learning is embedded into the curriculum. The Cilandak campus has a community feel, and many families use the pool and sports facilities at weekends. The PTA is active and well-organised.",
"intelligenceSummary": "The word among expat families is that JIS is the big, established name - the school most corporate packages are written around and the one relocation agents mention first. Founded in 1951, it has the history, the scale, and the resources that come with being Jakarta's largest international school. Parents describe it as offering an American-influenced education with a broad international mix of students. The main Cilandak campus runs Early Childhood through High School, while Pattimura in Kebayoran Baru takes Elementary (K-5).\n\nFamilies who've been here a few years tend to say the strengths are real - strong university placements, a huge range of activities, and a community that feels like a small town. The flip side is that it's expensive (the most expensive in Jakarta), the campus is ageing, and at 2,500+ students it can feel impersonal if your child isn't the type to put their hand up. It suits families who want breadth of opportunity and don't mind a bigger, busier environment.\n\nThe general consensus: if your company is paying and your child is reasonably outgoing, JIS is a safe and solid choice. If you're self-funding or want a smaller, more personal setup, it's worth looking at what else is out there.",
"intelligencePositives": "Strong university placement track record - graduates regularly go on to well-known US, UK, and Australian universities, with a solid Ivy League and Oxbridge pipeline. Parents say the college counselling team is experienced and well-connected. | Diverse student body with 60+ nationalities and no single group dominating - parents value the fact that their children mix with families from all over the world rather than one or two dominant communities. | Serious sports programme through IASAS, competing against top international schools across Southeast Asia. Good range of team and individual sports, and high participation rates across the secondary school. | Large-scale arts and performing arts programme - annual musicals, orchestra, and dedicated performance spaces mean students who are into drama, music, or visual arts have real outlets and resources. | Well-established alumni network going back over 70 years - useful for older students thinking about university applications, internships, and career connections.",
"intelligenceConsiderations": "At IDR 527M+ per year rising to IDR 604M for IB, JIS is comfortably the most expensive school in Jakarta. The gap between JIS and the next tier down is significant - make sure you're clear on what the premium buys you before committing. | The Cilandak campus dates from the mid-1970s and parts of it are showing their age. A renovation programme is underway but it's a big site and there's still plenty of work to do. Don't expect gleaming, purpose-built facilities throughout. | Traffic around the Cilandak campus at drop-off is a genuine headache. Jl. Terogong Raya backs up badly between 7:15 and 7:45 AM. Families who live in BSD or Tangerang should factor in a long commute. | With 2,500+ students, JIS is a big school. Parents of quieter children sometimes say their kids can get lost in the crowd, particularly in middle school. It works well for confident, outgoing students - less so for those who need to be drawn out. | The American-influenced approach - first-name basis with teachers, emphasis on student voice and choice - suits some families but feels too informal for those coming from British or more traditional Asian school cultures.",

"intelligenceSummary": "The word among expat families is that BSJ is the established British option in Jakarta, sitting alongside JIS and ISJ as one of the top-tier international schools. The 45-acre Bintaro campus is one of the largest school sites in Indonesia, and the British curriculum through to IB Diploma is a well-trodden path. Parents describe a school that feels structured and traditional, with a strong sense of community.\n\nThe main trade-off is location. Bintaro is a fair distance from central Jakarta, and families who don't live nearby face a significant commute. The British culture runs deep (house system, prefects, cricket), which suits some families and feels unfamiliar to others. Academically, IB results are solid, and the breadth of activities is notable for Jakarta.",
"intelligencePositives": "Large 45-acre campus with extensive sports facilities including a 50-metre pool, multiple football pitches, tennis courts, and an athletics track. One of the biggest school campuses in Indonesia. | IB results are solid, with an average around 35 and a pass rate near 98%. Graduates go on to well-known universities in the UK, US, Australia, and elsewhere. | Manchester City FC partnership brings professional football coaching to campus. Student participation in the football programme is high. | Over 260 co-curricular activities with high participation rates. The Duke of Edinburgh programme and debate team are popular options. | Founded in 1974, BSJ has a long-established alumni network. It was the first British school in Indonesia and has deep roots in the expat community.",
"intelligenceConsiderations": "Bintaro is about 22km from central Jakarta. Morning commute can be 35-45 minutes via the JORR toll road, or over an hour in heavy traffic. Most BSJ families live nearby in Bintaro or BSD. | The school follows the British National Curriculum through IGCSE, then switches to IB at Year 12. Families wanting IB from primary age may prefer a full-continuum IB school. | Bus routes from central Jakarta can mean early mornings. The longest routes take over an hour, with pickups starting around 6:30 AM. | The culture is distinctly British, with a house system, prefects, formal assemblies, and sports like rugby and cricket. This suits some families and feels unfamiliar to others. | The student body leans British in character, which is a draw for some families and a limitation for those seeking a more internationally blended environment.",

"intelligenceSummary": "Parents describe ISJ as the small, personal British option in Jakarta's international school landscape. Part of The Schools Trust network, it serves around 200 children aged 2 to 13 in the Pondok Pinang area, with year groups expanding progressively. The teaching staff are recruited from well-regarded UK schools, and with class sizes capped at 16, the level of individual attention is a genuine differentiator from larger schools like JIS and BSJ.\n\nThe trade-off is clear: ISJ doesn't yet run through to Year 13, so families need to plan a transition to a senior school. The smaller scale also means fewer activities and a narrower peer group. For families who prioritise a British prep school feel with close teacher-student relationships, it's a strong fit. For those wanting a full K-12 journey or a wide menu of extracurriculars, the bigger schools may suit better.",
"intelligencePositives": "Teaching staff are recruited from well-regarded UK independent schools and most have significant classroom experience. The school maintains small class sizes of up to 16 students. | With around 200 students, every child is known by name. Parents report strong communication from teachers and easy access to the head. | The school is expanding year groups progressively, adding one new year group per year. Early families have had input into shaping school culture. | Holds accreditation from COBIS, BSO, IAPS, and The Schools Trust, which is a broad set of endorsements for a school of this size. | Graduates have moved on to senior schools including BSJ, JIS, Harrow Bangkok, and UK boarding schools. The school provides dedicated placement support from Year 6.",
"intelligenceConsiderations": "Currently serves ages 2 to 13 only. Families need to plan a transition to a senior school, which adds complexity compared to K-12 options. | The smaller scale means fewer co-curricular activities than larger schools. The range is narrower, though participation rates are high. | Founded in 2018, so it is still a relatively young school without a long track record or established alumni network. | Exclusively British curriculum. Families wanting IB, American AP, or bilingual Mandarin programmes will need to look elsewhere. | Fees are positioned between local private schools and the top-tier internationals.

"schoolLifeDescription": "Life at AIS Jakarta reflects Australian educational values of wellbeing, inclusion, and inquiry. The school offers extracurricular activities including sports, arts, and community service. The approach creates a supportive environment for students to take academic risks and develop confidence.",
"intelligenceSummary": "Parents say AIS is where you go if your family has ties to Australia or you simply want a less pressured, wellbeing-focused school. It is the only school in Jakarta offering the full Australian Curriculum, which means seamless transfers to and from Australia for families on rotation. The IB Diploma is available for Years 11-12. The Pejaten campus is convenient for the Kemang expat community.\n\nThe trade-off is that the Australian Curriculum is less universally recognised by US and UK universities than the IB alone, and the campus is more compact than the big suburban schools. For families who value wellbeing over academic intensity, and especially those with Australian connections, AIS is a well-regarded choice.",
"intelligencePositives": "Jakarta's only school offering the complete Australian Curriculum (ACARA) from Preschool through Year 10. Students transfer to and from Australian schools with curriculum alignment. | Strong wellbeing focus with dedicated counsellors, learning support specialists, and an EAL team. The school supports students with a range of learning differences. | The IB Diploma provides an internationally recognised qualification for Years 11-12. Graduates are placed at universities across Australia, Asia, the UK, and North America. | Pejaten campus is close to Kemang and TB Simatupang, with school bus routes covering South Jakarta. | Sister campus in Bali allows families to transfer between Jakarta and Bali with curriculum continuity.",
"intelligenceConsiderations": "The Australian Curriculum is less familiar to US and UK university admissions than IB or AP. The IB Diploma in Years 11-12 addresses this, but it is worth considering. | The school has around 800 students, making it more intimate than larger schools. This suits some families but means fewer activity options and peer groups. | AIS emphasises wellbeing and character development over academic pressure. Families seeking a high-intensity academic environment may prefer other options. | The Pejaten campus is compact compared to large suburban campuses. Swimming carnivals and some athletics events are held off-site. | Best suited for families with Australian ties or those who value the Australian educational approach. Families specifically seeking British or American pathways have other options.",

Catholic formation is central to the community, not just a formality.\n\nFor Catholic families in West Jakarta who want the IB pathway, Tunas Muda is a natural fit. Families should be aware that fees sit at the mid-to-upper range for Jakarta IB schools, and the smaller size means fewer extracurricular options compared to the big three (JIS, BSJ, ISJ).",

"intelligenceConsiderations": "The student body is around 70% Indonesian. Families looking for a more internationally blended environment will find the cultural mix different from Western-majority schools. | The campus is compact and urban. Families wanting large suburban grounds with extensive outdoor sport facilities should look at BSD or Bintaro options. | The BINUS brand is well-known in Indonesia and Asia but less familiar to US and UK university admissions offices. | IB average of 34 with a 95% pass rate is solid but not at the top of the Jakarta league. Suits students seeking good IB outcomes without a high-pressure environment. | Most graduates pursue universities in Indonesia or Asia. Families seeking primarily Western university preparation may prefer other schools.",

"intelligenceSummary": "Parents say JMS is the school to look at if you want IB and Cambridge qualifications without paying JIS or BSJ fees. The 2-hectare campus in Cirendeu is green and spacious for a school at this price point, and it is about 15 minutes from Lebak Bulus MRT. The community is smaller and less internationally diverse than the big schools, but families describe it as safe, caring, and good value.\n\nThe trade-off is a lower profile, more modest facilities, and less published data on IB results and university placements. For budget-conscious families who want recognised international qualifications in a supportive environment, JMS is worth a visit.",
"intelligencePositives": "Fees are significantly lower than leading international schools while offering IB and Cambridge qualifications. | Green 2-hectare campus provides space for outdoor learning and sports, which is unusual at this price point. | Location is about 15 minutes from Lebak Bulus MRT, making it accessible for South Jakarta families. | Sibling discounts of 5-10% make it more affordable for families with multiple children. | Parents describe a safe, inclusive environment with strong pastoral care.",
"intelligenceConsiderations": "Lower profile than leading international schools like JIS or BSJ. | Smaller international community with approximately 15 nationalities represented. | IB results and university placement data are less publicly available than at larger schools. | Location in Cirendeu may be less convenient for families in central or east Jakarta. | Facilities are more modest compared to schools with larger budgets.",

Fees are relatively accessible for a non-profit, parent-managed school. The main consideration is whether the French curriculum aligns with your university targets - it is less familiar to Anglo-American admissions offices than the IB.",

"intelligenceSummary": "Parents say GMIS is the school to consider if you want curriculum flexibility at an affordable price. It is one of the few Jakarta schools offering IB, IGCSEs, and Indian curriculum pathways under one roof, which suits families who are not yet sure which route they want. With 2,000+ students from 50+ countries, the mix of nationalities is genuinely broad.\n\nThe Kemayoran location in Central Jakarta works well for North and Central Jakarta families but is less convenient from the south. The school was recognised at the World School Summit 2025. The trade-off for low fees is that facilities are more basic than at premium schools, and the large student body means less individual attention.",

"intelligenceSummary": "Parents say Pahoa is one of the few schools in Greater Jakarta offering genuine Mandarin immersion - early years classes run at roughly 70% Mandarin, and the language is used daily rather than taught as a subject. The Cambridge pathway gives families international recognition, and fees are notably lower than the established international schools.\n\nThe word among families is that the Green Building campus is distinctive - no air conditioning in classrooms, natural ventilation, and a rooftop garden. Some parents appreciate the environmental philosophy; others find the lack of AC a concern, particularly in Jakarta's heat.\n\nFor Indonesian Chinese families wanting deep Mandarin fluency with Cambridge qualifications, Pahoa is a strong option at a reasonable price. Families not committed to the Mandarin-heavy model or Confucian values framework should look elsewhere.",

"intelligenceSummary": "Parents say Sekolah Cita Buana stands out for its genuine commitment to inclusive education - it is one of the few schools in Jakarta that actively supports students with diverse learning needs in mainstream classrooms. The fees are among the lowest for any school offering international-standard curriculum, and flexible capital fee payment plans make it more accessible.\n\nThe word among families is that the bilingual IPC and Cambridge approach gives children decent English exposure without the price of premium international schools. The Jagakarsa campus is modest, and the school is smaller, which means fewer activities and a narrower peer group - but also a community where families know each other.\n\nFor South Jakarta families who value inclusion and affordability, it is a distinctive choice. Those who need IB or A-Level pathways for senior years, or who want a larger and more internationally diverse school, will need to consider other options.",
"intelligencePositives": "Among the most affordable international-standard schools in Jakarta, with flexible capital fee payment plans. | Genuinely inclusive education supporting students with diverse learning needs in mainstream classrooms. | IPC and Cambridge curriculum provides bilingual English-Indonesian instruction. | The Jagakarsa location is convenient for South Jakarta families.",
"intelligenceConsiderations": "No IB or A-Level pathway is available for senior years. | Jagakarsa location can be far from Central Jakarta. | International diversity is limited compared to expat-focused schools. | Smaller school size means fewer co-curricular options and networking opportunities. | The inclusive model means varied academic levels within the same classroom.",

The Bekasi location is a real factor - it works well for families living nearby but adds a long commute from Central or South Jakarta.\n\nFor families who prioritise IB education and are based in East Jakarta or Bekasi, this is a strong value option. Those expecting the campus scale and resources of premium schools should adjust expectations accordingly.",
"intelligencePositives": "Full IB continuum (PYP, MYP, DP) available at fees well below most Jakarta IB schools. | Authorised IB World School with inquiry-based learning embedded across all programmes. | Early Years programme starting from 6 months allows families to begin early. | The Bekasi location serves a growing community of internationally-minded families in the area.",
