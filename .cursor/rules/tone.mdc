# Editorial Voice & Tone Guide

## The Voice

We write like an experienced expat parent who has lived in the city for three years, done the school tours, spoken to dozens of families, and is now telling a friend what they actually need to know. We are informed, direct, occasionally dry, and never trying to sell anything.

We are not a school marketing team. We are not a brochure. We are not an AI summarising a school's website.

**The test:** If you read a sentence aloud and it sounds like it could appear in a school prospectus, rewrite it.

## Research Pipeline

Every school profile follows this process:

### Step 1: Gather real parent voices
Search Reddit (r/jakarta, r/expats, r/internationalschools), Facebook groups (Jakarta Expat Forum, Jakarta International School Parents), Quora, and school review sites for actual comments from parents, teachers, and alumni. Look for:
- Specific complaints (traffic, fees, teacher turnover, class sizes)
- Specific praise (named programmes, particular teachers or initiatives)
- Comparisons between schools ("we moved from X to Y because...")
- Insider knowledge (waitlist reality, hidden fees, admissions tips)

### Step 2: Synthesise into editorial intelligence
Take the raw comments and distil them into editorial paragraphs. Present the information as if we had spoken to people on the ground. Never attribute to "Reddit" or "Facebook" - attribute to "parents", "families who've been here a few years", "expat families", "the word among...", "the general consensus".

### Step 3: Apply the tone filter
Run every paragraph through the banned phrases list and the style rules below. Cut anything that sounds like AI wrote it.

### Step 4: Verify facts
Cross-check fee figures, exam results, and dates against official school websites. Editorial opinion is ours; factual claims must be accurate.

## Style Rules

### Dashes
- Use hyphens (-) not em-dashes.
- Maximum 2 hyphens per paragraph. If you need more, restructure the sentence.
- Never use hyphens as bullet-point separators within a sentence. Break into two sentences instead.

**Bad:** "BSJ has a 45-acre campus in Bintaro - the largest in Jakarta - with facilities that include an Olympic pool - three gyms - and a 750-seat theatre."

**Good:** "BSJ's 45-acre Bintaro campus is the largest of any international school in Jakarta. Facilities include an Olympic pool, three gyms, and a 750-seat theatre."

### Attribution
- "Parents say..." (not "Parents report...")
- "Families who've been here a few years say..." (not "Parents consistently praise...")
- "The word among expat families is..." (grounding phrase)
- "The general consensus..." (summarising phrase)
- "One thing families mention..." (specific insight opener)
- Never: "Parents note that..." / "It should be noted..." / "Parents report..."

### Sentence Structure
- Lead with the human experience, not the fact.
- **Bad:** "Class sizes average 12-14 students. This means teachers know students individually."
- **Good:** "At 12-14 per class, teachers know your child - not just their name, but their personality."

### Specificity
- Name streets, times, traffic patterns, neighbourhoods.
- **Bad:** "The location may involve a commute for some families."
- **Good:** "If you're in Menteng or Central Jakarta, you're looking at 40-50 minutes each way during morning rush. Families in BSD consider it a breeze."

### Contractions
- Use them. "It's", "don't", "you're", "that's". We're talking to a friend.

### Numbers
- Write fees in both IDR and USD where possible.
- Use "US$17K" not "USD 17,000" in running text.
- Use full figures in fee tables.

### Paragraphs
- No paragraph should exceed 4 sentences.
- The first sentence of each paragraph should carry the insight. Don't wind up.

### Positives & Considerations
- Each bullet should be 2-3 sentences maximum.
- Lead with the specific claim, then add context.
- **Bad:** "Strong university placement track record - graduates regularly go on to well-known US, UK, and Australian universities, with a solid Ivy League and Oxbridge pipeline. Parents say the college counselling team is experienced and well-connected."
- **Good:** "Graduates regularly reach Ivy League, Oxbridge, and Russell Group universities. Parents say the college counselling team is experienced and well-connected - one of the better operations in Jakarta."

---

## Verdict Format

The verdict (the bold summary at the top of each Intelligence section) should be:
- One sentence, maximum two.
- Written as direct advice to a parent.
- Include a qualifier or caveat - never unconditional praise.

**Good:** "If your company is paying and your child is reasonably outgoing, JIS is a safe, solid choice. If you're self-funding, it's worth comparing."

**Bad:** "BSJ is the strongest British-curriculum option in Jakarta with genuine community spirit and strong pastoral care."

## Paragraph Openers to Use

These create the grounded, people-told-us-this quality:

- "The word among expat families is..."
- "Families who've been here a few years tend to say..."
- "The general consensus..."
- "What comes up again and again is..."
- "One thing parents mention..."
- "If you ask around..."
- "The reality on the ground..."
- "Parents who've done the school tour circuit say..."

## Paragraph Openers to Avoid

- "What parents notice first is..."
- "It's worth highlighting that..."
- "The school has..."
- "Founded in [year], [school] is..."
- "With [number] students, [school]..."
- "The campus itself..."

## For AI Assistants

When writing or editing school profiles:

1. Read this file first.
2. Search for real parent comments on the school (Reddit, Quora, Facebook groups).
3. Write the Intelligence section using those comments as source material.
4. Run every paragraph through the banned phrases list.
5. Count your hyphens. Maximum 2 per paragraph.
6. Read every sentence aloud. Does it sound like a person talking, or a document describing?
7. Check your verdict. Is it advice to a parent, or a statement about a school?
